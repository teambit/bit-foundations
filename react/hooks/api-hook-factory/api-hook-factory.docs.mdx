### Overview

The ApiHookFactory allows creation of rest api hooks to consume any api context based on a provider utilising ApiContextProvider's provider factory.  

Api Hooks created with this factory will connect to and consume the `useXyzContext` of any api context that is based on the [rest-ful API context provider component](@learn-bit-react/movies.context.api-context-base),
and returns four items for managaing the API calls:
1. `apiCall` - the function which actually does the API call
1. `apiData` - the result of the API call
1. `isLoading` - true while the `apiCall` function is waiting to return
1. `error` - holds any errors returned by the API call

To create a hook using this factory, supply it with two parameters:
1. `apiCallConfig` - a `ContextConfigFunction` (see the api context provider linked to above), this function sets the parameters expected for the api call and how
to stitch them into the url.
1. `processData` - the function which will be used to process the raw api data to produce the desired output data for our consuming application from the hook .


See this component's compositions for an end-to-end usage example for creating a concrete hook with this factory.

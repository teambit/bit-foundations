## Overview

A customized version of the base react env, with support for react18.

### Usage instructions - default env with react18 support

If all you require is the base react env `teambit.react/react` but with react18 support (the base env currently only supports react 16/17) then do the following.
(If you also need custom configs see the section below):

1. Configure the env via the CLI
To configure this env for a component (or group of components) via the CLI, run `bit env set "some/*/glob/pattern/**" bit-foundations.react/react-version-envs/react-18-env@0.0.1`.
This will add a config section in your `.bitmap` file for the components this is run on. Note - this will override any env setting rules in your `workspace.jsonc` file.

2. Configure with Variants
Under the **variant** section of your `workspace.json` file choose which components you want to have the custom environment set. You can find the id of the extension in the `react-18-env.aspect.ts` file.

```json
{
  "teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "{ui/**}, {pages/**}": {
      "bit-foundations.react/react-version-envs/react-18-env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage with customised configs

1. If you are creating a new env for which you require react18 support and the ability to customise its configs, you should [fork](https://bit.dev/docs/reference/cli-reference#format) this env:

```bash
bit fork bit-foundations.react/react-version-envs/react-18-env@0.0.1 <your-env-name>
```

2. If you just wish to upgrade your existing custom env to be react18 compatible then just copy over the `overrideDependencies` content in this env's main.runtime.ts file to your
own custom env's main.runtime.ts file.

:::warning
This will remove support for react16 and react17 from components built with this env. If you wish to preserve your existing react16+17 compatible env but
also create an identical react18 env, then please `bit fork` your own custom env and adjust the `overrideDependencies` as above for the forked version
of your own env.

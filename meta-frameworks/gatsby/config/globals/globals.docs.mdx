description: 'component which registers gatsby globals for rendering gatsby components outside a gatsby app'
---

# Overview

This component exposes a single function, whose purpose is to register global Gatsby variables to enable rendering of Gatsby components
outside of a Gatsby app. 

This function can be used, for instance, inside a Bit env's preview file to enable rendering of Gatsby components in Bit compositions.

## Gatsby Globals

### Gatsby's Link overrides

Gatsby Link calls the `enqueue` & `hovering` methods on the global variable ___loader.
This global object isn't set in non-Gatsby context, requiring you to override it to empty functions (no-op),
so Gatsby Link doesn't throw errors.

```js
  globalCtx.___loader = {
      enqueue: () => {},
      hovering: () => {},
    }

```

### Others

This global variable prevents the "__BASE_PATH__ is not defined" error when using Gatsby components outside a Gatsby application..
```js
globalCtx.__BASE_PATH__ = "/"
```

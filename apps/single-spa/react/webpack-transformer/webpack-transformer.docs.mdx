## Usage

Use this webpack transformer with a bit app-type component to produce a react single-spa output. 

Supply it with options in the form of:

``` js
const opts: any = {
  orgName: "teambit-singlespa",
  projectName: "react-example",
  orgPackagesAsExternal: true,
  rootDirectoryLevel: 1,
  webpackConfigEnv: {
      standalone: false,
  },
  standaloneOptions: {},
};
```

For details on how each item is used and its effect on your output bundle, see the transformer code itself.

:::note 
The `orgName` value is important as webpack will automatically assign `@<org-name>` as an external dependency for the application, to be supplied to the single-spa 
application via importmap. It has no relation to your bit organisation, so feel free to choose any name you like - and then use it consistently in your single-spa setup.

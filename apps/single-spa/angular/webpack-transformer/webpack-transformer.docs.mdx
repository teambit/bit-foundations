description: 'A webpack transformer for configuring Angular bit app components as a single-spa application'
---

## Description

This webpack transformer can be used in conjunction with a Bit Angular-App component to configure that app component as a consumable single-spa application.

## Usage

In the `.ng-app.ts` file of the angular-app component, add this transformer to the `webpackTransformers` array, and provide it with the angularOptions in the same file as
the input parameter.

This will then configure the webpack bundler for the app to output a single-spa bundle to be consumed inside any single-spa root application.

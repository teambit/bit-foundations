description: 'templates for scaffolding styling-related bit components and aspects'

## Overview

This aspect is a generator aspect for foundational styling-related components to be used with bit, i.e. it exposes a number of bit templates for scaffolding those foundational components. 

For instance, this generator contains a template for creating a tailwind-configured custom react environment. All you need to do is run `bit create tailwind-env` and 
you will be the owner of a brand new custom env with tailwind support (and some default config which you'll probably want to change).

### Using this generator in your workspace

In order to make the templates in this generator available in your workspace, edit your `workspace.jsonc` file and add the following entry to teambit generator (add the generator section
if it doesn't already exist). This should go at root level. 

```json
{ //workspace.jsonc
  "teambit.generator/generator": {
    "aspects": ["bit-foundations.styling/templates/styling-templates@<version>"]
  },
}
```

This registers the component aspect in your workspace, so that your templates will appear in the CLI when you run `bit templates`.

### Using the templates

Available templates from this Generator:
1. `tailwind-env`

Use your generator to create the component files

```bash
bit create <template-name> <my-component-name>
```

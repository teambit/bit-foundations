# Overview

This component is a shareable webpack transform, which configures your webpack to produce a UMD output for runtime consumption of your component.  
It can accept an optional argument for the app name, which will be used as the library output name. 

> IMPORTANT NOTE: there can only be one `output` configuration in a webpack object, so this will override any other `output`s configured prrio to running this transform.

## Precursors

This component assumes that you already have a custom env in which you will apply this transform to mutate the existing webpack configuration. 
If you don't yet have a custom env, see our [docs](https://harmony-docs.bit.dev/building-with-bit/environments#customizing-environments) for details on how to create one.

## Usage

This component customises your env's webpack configuration via the UseWebpack function from the core env you are customising.

```js
// main.runtime.ts of your env

import { umdWebpackTransformer } from '@bit-foundations/deploy.umd.webpack-transforms';

// inside provider function
  react.useWebpack({
    previewConfig: [umdWebpackTransformer("optionalAppName")],
    devServerConfig: [umdWebpackTransformer("optionalAppName")],
  }),

```
